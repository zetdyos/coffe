{% extends "base.html" %}{% load i18n %}
{% comment %}

    This template only exists to support the non-Ajax pages. Those are:
    - links to the moderation options in the email.
    - Pages for visitors with JavaScript disabled.

    Those pages are rendered with "comments/base.html" as base template.

    This file simply maps those blocks (headtitle, extrahead and content)
    to the blocks that are found in the site theme base template.
    See for example:

        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/posted/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/flag/1/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/flagged/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/delete/1/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/deleted/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/approve/1/
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/comments/approved/

{% endcomment %}

{% block headtitle %}{% trans "Responses for page" %}{% endblock %}

{% block main %}
    <h1>Comments</h1>

    <div id="content">
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </div>
{% endblock %}

{# NOTE that the base template also needs to have an 'extrahead' block, or map it here like 'main' and 'headtitle' are mapped. #}
